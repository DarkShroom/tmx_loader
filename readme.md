another tiled map loader

loads tmx files, attempts to create a logical object orienatated reflection of the file

understands rotations etc, rather than using flip uses 3 flip flags, represents as a direction and flip

trys to use the names in the Tiled editor rather than the underlying XML names



code currently in a very unsable state!!
